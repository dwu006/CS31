Daniel Wu, Fall 2024 CS 31 - Homework 2

Report:
a. I accidentally uninstalled msys2 because I forgot I need that for the g++ compiler in visual studio code, so that took awhile to figure out. For the project, I had a little difficulty with cin and getline. I forgot to use cin.ignore which kept skipping the customer name input and going to the luxury car input and made a mistake of not initializing the rentalCharge variable at the start.

b. 
Negative starting odometer reading (-100)
Smaller ending odometer reading (100, 50)
Negative Rental Days (50, 100, -1)
Empty String for customer name (50, 100, 4, "")
Didn't enter y or n for luxury status (50, 100, 4, "Daniel Wu", a)
Entered 0 for month number (50, 100, 4, "Daniel Wu", "y", 0)
