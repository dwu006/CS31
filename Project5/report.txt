Daniel Wu - CS31 Fall 2024 Project 5 report

a. Some obstacles I faced was checking the number of stars and planets in each guess. I had to make sure I didn't count one letter as both a star and a planet, so
I used a for loop to check the char at a pos from both guess and the selected word and if it didnt match check if it does exist in the char exists in the selected 
word and this can determine if I increment stars or planets. I also had to create a loop and a check algorithm to ensure the guess is a valid test, by looping to 
check the case of each char in guess and if length of guess is too short or too long and also checking if the guess is in the array. 


b. 

int runOneRound(char words[][], int nWords, int wordnum) 
returns int, takes 2d array of cstrings, # of cstrings in array, index of selected word

if # of cstrings is less than 1, index of selected word is less than 0, or index is greater than # of words
    return -1
